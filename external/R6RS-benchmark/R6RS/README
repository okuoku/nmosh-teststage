This directory contains a set of R6RS benchmarks.  Some were
originally collected by Richard Gabriel, while others were
collected or written by Marc Feeley and Will Clinger.
Abdulaziz Ghuloum converted about 50 of these benchmarks to
R6RS libraries.  R6RS libraries are non-portable by design,
however, so Clinger rewrote the benchmarks as R6RS top-level
programs and added a script for running the benchmarks on
Unix systems.  Clinger also added new benchmarks for R6RS.

Files and directories:

  * bench   : a shell script for running benchmarks
  * src     : contains R6RS code for the benchmarks
  * inputs  : contains inputs for the benchmarks
  * outputs : will hold the outputs of some benchmarks

For succinct instructions on running benchmarks, run the
bench script without any arguments:

  % ./bench

The bench script creates a /tmp/larcenous directory to hold
the source code constructed for the benchmarks.

The bench script appends its results to files with names
like results.Ikarus, results.Larceny, and so forth.

================================================================

NOTE:
The nbody, trav1, and trav2 benchmarks have been dropped because
the depend upon a non-portable order of evaluation.  The sumloop
benchmark has been dropped because it was essentially the same
as the sum benchmark.  The boyer benchmark has been replaced by
the nboyer and sboyer benchmarks, which are fundamentally better
benchmarks, with fewer bugs, and scalable.  The gcold benchmark
has been dropped temporarily because its initialization phase is
so long compared to the benchmark phase, and the R6RS provides
no portable way to time those phases separately.
